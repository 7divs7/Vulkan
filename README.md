# Inspiration
Wanna draw cool graffitis or make your own wallpapers but not so good at it??ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜€
Our not-so-good artistic skills and decent engineering competence inspired us to come up with VULKAN!

# What is Vulkan
Vulkan is a self-contained bot that can draw graffiti having minimal complexity on walls. It harnesses the power of the vacuum and IoT to help make your walls beautiful.

# How Stuff Works
Here's an instruction manual to operate Vulkan:
 
1. Power up Vulkan and launch our UI based application on your laptop. 
2. Draw your favourite graffiti and let your imagination run wild!
3. Hit the SEND button. Congrats! you've just done your part of the job. Now your graffiti is wirelessly sent to Vulkan over a socket connection and it starts automatically.
4. The BLDC propellers fire up and create the required suction force.
5. The drive motors start turning in quantized steps, and the servo motors for the brush sync up for the perfect strokes!
6. At the end of every row, our custom-designed edge manoeuvre ensures that the bot is facing the right way before drawing the subsequent rows.
7. Sit back and watch Vulkan in action!
